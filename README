1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" program module
    extends the Perl language.

    The input to "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" is the __DATA__ section of Software
    Test Description (STD) program module. The __DATA__ section must contain
    STD forms text database in the DataPort::FileType::DataDB format.

    Use the "vmake.pl" (version make) cover script for Test::STDmaker to
    process a SVD program module as follows:

      vmake Docs::Site_SVD::MySVDmodule

    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module will then provide some automation of
    releaseing a Perl distribution file as follows:

    *   The input data for the ExtUtils::SVDmaker is a form database file in
        the format of DataPort::FileType::FormDB. This is a efficient text
        database that is very close in format to hard copy forms and may be
        edited by text editors

    *   compares the contents of the current release with the previous
        release and automatically updates the version and date for files
        that have changed

    *   generates a SVD program module from the form database data.

    *   generates MANIFEST, README and Makefile.PL distribution files from
        the form database data

    *   Builds the distribution *.tar.gz file

    *   Runs the installation tests on the distribution files

    The ExtUtils::SVDmaker module is one of the end user, functional
    interface modules for the US DOD STD2167A bundle. Two STD2167A bundle
    end user modules are as follows:

    Test::STDmaker module
        generates Test script, demo script and STD document POD from a text
        database in the Data::Port::FileTYpe::FormDB format.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker module
        generates SVD document POD and distribution *.tar.gz file including
        a generated Makefile.PL README and MANIFEST file from a text
        database in the Data::Port::FileTYpe::FormDB format.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     File::TestPath File::Package File::SmartNL
       Text::Scrub
         Test::Tech

            DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile DataPort::Maker Text::Replace
            Text::Column File::PM2File File::Data File::AnySpec File::SubPM

                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    The top level modules that establish the functional interface of
    interest to the end user are the Test::STDmaker and the
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker modules. The rest of the modules in the above
    dependency tree are design modules for the US DOD STD2167A bundle. They
    are broken out as separate modules because they may be of use outside of
    the US DOD STD2167A bundle.

    Note the File::FileUtil, Test::STD::STDutil Test::STD::Scrub program
    modules breaks up the Test::TestUtil program module and Test::TestUtil
    has disappeared.

        systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
        following web sites:

         http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
         http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com
